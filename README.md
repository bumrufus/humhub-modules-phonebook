# Description


Based on the core module directory

A simple phonebook with Ajax Search

I've developed it for my personal use. 

First u have to change the fields displayed in the list -> u have to change it here:

https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/6b938c00e2b361c1971bb9199bac2bd3962a9e75/views/index/index.php#L30-L39

and here:

https://github.com/bumrufus/humhub-modules-phonebook/blob/6b938c00e2b361c1971bb9199bac2bd3962a9e75/views/index/index.php#L97-L105

The fields are located here: Administration -> Users -> Profiles -> select a Profile -> Internal Name

Sorry if it's not perfectly developed, but this is my first module :-)

# TODOS:

- ~~cleanup the mess :-)~~
- ~~remove the css ans js from the view files~~
- ~~add translation~~
- ~~add sort by field option~~
- load field titles directly from profile fields
- add a admin settings page to allow users to change the displayed fields and to change the sort order and pagesize
- add pagination option
